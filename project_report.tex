\section{Constants and Variables in Memory}

Note: All data stored below are of data type ``word''.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Address of the display: \verb+ADDR_DSPL = 0x10008000+
\item Address of keyboard input: \verb+ADDR_KBRD = 0xffff0000+
\\
\item Color of the side walls (and the top bar): \verb+COLOR_WALLS = 0x00888888+
\item Thickness (in units) of the top bar: \verb+TOP_BAR_THICKNESS = 8+
\item Thickness (in units) of the side walls: \verb+SIDE_WALL_THICKNESS = 2+
\item Gap (in units) between the top bar and the first row of bricks: \verb+TOP_GAP_THICKNESS = 8+
\\
\item Thickness (in units) of a row of bricks: \verb+BRICK_ROW_THICKNESS = 2+
\item The number of rows of bricks: \verb+BRICK_ROW_AMOUNT = 7+
\item An array containing the colors of each row of bricks: \\ \verb+BRICK_COLORS = [0x008062e0, 0x007173c6, 0x006283ac, 0x00539492,+\\ \verb+                0x0043a577, 0x0034b55d, 0x0025c643]+
\\
\item The y-coordinate of the paddle (constant): \verb+PADDLE_Y = 61+
\item The x-coordinates of the paddle, these are variable, one stores the x-coordinate of the leftmost pixel of the paddle, one stores the rightmost. This enables us to adjust the length of the paddle, and makes it easier for us to update its position:\\ \verb+PADDLE_X_LEFT = 26+ ; \verb+PADDLE_X_RIGHT = 36+
\\
\item The position of the ball (this is a variable): \verb+BALL_X = 31+ ; \verb+BALL_Y = 58+
\item The movement vectors for the ball (each cycle the balls position are calculated as such: \verb%BALL_X = BALL_X + VEC_X% ; \verb%BALL_Y = BALL_Y + VEC_Y% ). For ease of calculation, \verb+VEC_X+ and \verb+VEC_Y+ can only be either 1 or -1:\\ \verb+VEC_X = 1+ ; \verb+VEC_Y = 1+

\section{Collision Algorithm}

In each game cycle, we check the 4 pixels directly adjacent to the pixel where the ball is at: \verb%(BALL_X + 1, BALL_Y)%, \verb%(BALL_X - 1, BALL_Y)%, \verb%(BALL_X, BALL_Y + 1)%, \verb%(BALL_X, BALL_Y - 1)%. If any of the 4 pixels are not the default black background (0x00000000), then we have ``touched" something. 

And since we are only moving diagonally, the process is as follows:

If the ball is touching something on it's left or right, i.e. \verb%(BALL_X + 1, BALL_Y)% or \verb%(BALL_X - 1, BALL_Y)%, then we invert the sign of \verb+VEC_X+. (\verb+VEC_X = - VEC_X+) So that when we update the position of the ball using \verb%BALL_X += VEC_X%. It will go the opposite direction than where it was going.

Likewise, if the ball is touching something on it's top or bottom, i.e. \verb%(BALL_X, BALL_Y + 1)% or \verb%(BALL_X, BALL_Y - 1)%, then we invert the sign of \verb+VEC_Y+. (\verb+VEC_Y = - VEC_Y+) So that when we update the position of the ball using \verb%BALL_Y += VEC_Y%. It will go the opposite direction than where it was going.

These 2 cases can have either one applied, or both applied to the directional vectors of the ball.
